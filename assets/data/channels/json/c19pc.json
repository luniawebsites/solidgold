	"description": "<h3>Equity and solidarity</h3><p>The C19 People’s Coalition is an emerging civil society collective seeking to ensure that South Africa’s response to the Covid-19 crisis is one that is rooted in social justice and democratic principles, and recognises our duty to prioritise those who are most vulnerable, who face the pandemic with hunger, weakened immune systems and poor access to housing, health care and social safety nets."

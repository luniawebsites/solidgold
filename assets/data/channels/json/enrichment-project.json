	"description": "<h3>Path to Purpose</h3><p>Join me in a series of unfiltered conversations with some of the most remarkable purpose-driven humans who have all either achieved, accomplished, created, inspired, overcome or triumphed. It is a quest to understand what purpose really is and to uncover and articulate the steps along the way to help you get there.</p><p>I didnâ€™t survive brain cancer three times just to survive brain cancer. My own purpose is to help others along the path to a fully engaged, fiercely connected and purpose-drenched life.</p><p>Every purpose was at one point simply an idea."

	"description": "<h3>South Africans are great explorers and can be found anywhere in the world.</h3><p>Whether they choose to remain in South Africa or to move, they are resilient and can settle anywhere and find a way to make an income and support their family.</p><p>In my podcasts I interview people who have either chosen to stay (and have created a way to make it work) or have left and settled somewhere else in the world. They each share share their journeys and each one is asked a question at the end... 'Given what they know now, would they have made the same choice?'</p><p>It’s a personal observation and not designed to influence others in the same situation, but it does allow those who are thinking of leaving home and moving halfway across the world, to have a wider knowledge about what to expect. Stay or go? It’s up to you."

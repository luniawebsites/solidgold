And as a seasoned interviewer living in South Africa but having visited over 80 countries and meeting many people on that journey, I have the perfect platform to get the best out of them.</p><p>I have been publishing magazines since 2000 and on radio since 1998. Debates, interviews and just stories, this channel has them all. Enjoy each one for what they are designed to be. Entertaining, heartfelt, inspiring and sometimes hard to hear."

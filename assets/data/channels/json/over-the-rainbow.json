	"description": "<h3>Are you over the Rainbow Nation promise?</h3><p>Was there ever a Rainbow Nation to begin with?</p><p>It's been 27 years since South Africa became a democracy; the same number of years former president Nelson Mandela was kept behind bars.</p><p>It also just so happens to be our international dialing code. It feels like a significant number.</p><p>I don't know about you, but I don't want South Africa's next 27 years to look like the last 27 years. "

	"description": "<h3>Imagine a world where there were only a few kinds vegetable seeds to grow to eat, with very limited choice.</h3><p>That’s what the situation was in 2010 when Linda Galvad was looking for interesting vegetables to feed her growing interest in the effects of good food on the body and mind, and her culinary skills adventure.</p><p>Before she knew it, after exploring overseas offerings, she had been appointed the Franchi Sementi sub-Saharan Africa agent for these amazing vegetable seeds.</p><p>It was difficult to import these new varieties and finally permission was granted with each packet of every variety offered, there had to be a sticker, marked “experimental”, and every purchaser recorded.</p><p>After two years, Linda was given the all clear, and we celebrated the availability of all these wonderful, exciting and unusual vegetable seeds that are now permanently and prolifically on offer."

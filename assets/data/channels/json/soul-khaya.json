	"description": "<h3>My commitment to all whom I encounter is to infuse every aspect of your experience by honouring the ancient wisdom of harmony, rhythm and flow.</h3><p>I invite you to come to release and reconnect with your true essence for a shift from the world of doing into the world of being.</p><p>I have a deep knowing that acceptance of the present moment is where peace lies. There is nowhere to go, and nothing to be done, just one breath can take us into being, and the only requirement is allowance."

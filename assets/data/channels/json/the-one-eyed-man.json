	"description": "<h3>In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king</h3><p>It's a messy, complicated world out there. We need better solutions to the problems around us, and better leaders to them. No one person has it all figured out, but in a quest to discover a more impactful brand of leadership, I'm having conversations with people who have at least some part of it figured out, and specifically in the fields of business, entrepreneurship, impact and technology.

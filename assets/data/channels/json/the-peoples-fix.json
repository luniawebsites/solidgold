	"description": "Action 24 - Active Citizens for Responsive Legislatures, an initiative co-funded by the European Union and the Friedrich Ebert Stiftung, has been engaging civil society organisations, the media, the Provincial Legislatures, and you - the citizens of South Africa - on ways that we can work together for a more effective governance system, in which our elected representatives ensure that the people have the last say when it comes to the decisions that affect their future."

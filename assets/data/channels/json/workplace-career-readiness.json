	"description": "<h3>Internship is a process, Graduate Placement is the solution</h3><p>The South African Council for Graduates Cooperative (SACGRA) strives to develop competent graduates that can become successful entrepreneurs or competitive employees. Through this we aim to contribute towards making South Africa a winning nation.</p><p>We empower students and graduates to have a productive work ethic and be globally competitive through partnership with industry leaders.</p><p>All university and college final year students are invited to register in the SACGRA database to secure their first internship or employment. It is my delight to invite private and public sector entities to partner with the SACGRA to grow high calibre graduates."

		<p>The hard work is behind you, now it's time to leverage the content and use additional distribution channels. One of the fastest growing methods books are shared and sold is as an Audiobook.</p>

		<p>This option has traditionally been prohibitively expensive, making it it unavailable to most self-published authors - until now!</p>

		<p>Here at Solid Gold Studios, we have built dedicated studios (available at very affordable weekly rates) that are perfect for authors to <strong>self-read</strong> (<a href="https://podlink.to/garageband">listen to the Adam Alexander example</a>) and record their books. You can also hire your own <strong>professional voice</strong> (<a href="http://podlink.to/patient">listen to malcolm Gooding read</a>)to do the reading if you prefer. We'll also help teach you to edit the recordings and get them published on Audible, or alternatively, one of our team of qualified editors can do some (or all) of the editing for you.</p>

		<p>Our recommendation is that 1 to 3 chapters (or the foreword) are made available as a podcast so that you can use that in all your marketing. It is by far the easiest way for people to "try before they buy"</p>

		<p>Here are 2 examples of books that are marketed this way.</p>

		<p>See if you can spot how the <strong>"buy now"</strong> call to action is built in.</p>

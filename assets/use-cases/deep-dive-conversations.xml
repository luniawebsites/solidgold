		<p>It's often the case that, once we identify better with someone, or understand their <i>why</i>, we can't wait to work with them and support their businesses and causes.</p>

		<p>The music industry is an excellent example of a space in which a handful of people become stars, and thousands of aspirant artists want to know how they did it so they can follow in their footsteps. In 2019, <i>Red Bull Music</i> teamed up with South Africa's top rap artists (including Nasty C and Rowlene) to provide fans with an opportunity to leap-frog their way to fame. You can <a href="https://www.redbull.com/za-en/events/Lift-As-You-Rise" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Read more about Lift As You Rise" id="section_usecase_xml_liftasyou" aria-labelledby="section_usecase_xml_liftasyou">read more about <i>Lift As You Rise</i></a>, and how the project worked, on the Red Bull page.</p>

		<p>The artists involved in the project spent some time in the Solid Gold Podcast Studios having a very deep and meaningful conversation about <strong>why</strong> they were collaborating on this, how they came to be famous, and what they were doing to give back to others. These are not <i>light and fluffy</i> sound bites that can simply be posted on social feeds. They are much more meaningful insights and thoughts that take more time to convey.</p>

		<p>Podcasts are the ideal way to deliver this kind of conversation.</p>

		<p>Not only can you <a href="http://fanlink.to/layr" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Share in their conversation" id="section_usecase_xml_shareintheir" aria-labelledby="section_usecase_xml_shareintheir">share in their conversation</a>, you can do the same to share your origin story and build an amazing rapport with your potential clients.</p>

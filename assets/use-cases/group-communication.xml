		<p>Women in Mining South Africa (WiMSA) creates an empowering network to inspire, support and develop the progression of women working in the South African mining industry.</p>

		<p>Whilst communication is essential in the furtherance of these objectives, WiMSA is a volunteer-led organisation and therefore requires very effective and low-maintenance communication methods that still enable meaningful information to be easily shared and consumed.</p>

		<p><i>Network</i>, <a href="https://podlink.to/network" title="WiMSA's own podcast channel" id="section_usecase_xml_wimsasownpodcast" aria-labelledby="section_usecase_xml_wimsasownpodcast">WiMSA's own podcast channel</a>, is the ideal solution as it enables the Chairperson, and committee members, to regularly update their members in a non-intrusive yet easy to access way. Podcasts are listened to <i>while</i> doing something else, and <i>not instead</i> of doing something elseâ€”usually while commuting, exercising or even cooking dinner. This makes Network an ideal method to keep all WiMSA members up-to-date.</p>

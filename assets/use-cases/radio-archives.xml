		<p>At the end of their regular radio show on FM, your favourite DJ is likely to sign-off by reminding you to catch any parts of the show you missed on their website as a podcast.  Whilst the “true” podcasters of the world will be shuddering to hear this, it is a useful, and effective, method of storing and archiving large volumes of audio content.</p>

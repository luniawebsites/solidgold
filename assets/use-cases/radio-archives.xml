		<p>At the end of their regular radio show on FM, your favourite DJ is likely to sign-off by reminding you to catch any parts of the show you missed on their website as a podcast.  Whilst the “true” podcasters of the world will be shuddering to hear this, it is a useful, and effective, method of storing and archiving large volumes of audio content.</p>

		<p>If you have a back-catalogue of content that you believe should be shared with the world, perhaps something like Lance Zeeman's Weekly <a href="https://podlink.to/entertainment">Entertainment Report</a> that goes out weekly on Hot 91.9 FM, then we can help you to set that up as a dedicated channel for you.</p>

		<p>Revive, refresh, and re-purpose your archived content.</p>

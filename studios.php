					<h1 class="text-l-mob">Our Studios</h1>
					<p class="text-l-mob">Every Solid Gold studio is air-conditioned, comfortably furnished, and professionally equipped for quality recordings. We understand and appreciate that to have open, honest, and meaningful conversations, hosts and guests alike need to feel comfortable and safe. We also understand that our clients' recording, production, editing, and hosting needs vary in complexity and budget.</p>
					<p class="text-l-mob">To cater for this, we have built a range of different studios suited for vaarious options, and we're certain one of them is perfect for your specific needs. From the large high-counter studio (perfect for group conversations) to the DIY studio (ideal for hobbyists) and the post-production studio (where the focus is on large client/producer/director seating area) we have a studio for you.</p>
					<p class="text-l-mob">7 (yes, seven) new Studios are coming soon, including a large multi-purpose studio catering for 'fireside conversations', 'couch conversations', 'wingback chair interviews' and has camera capacity for simultaneous YouTube recording.</p>					
					<p class="text-l-mob">All studios can record Skype/WhatsApp/telephone conversations as well as additional Client sources (e.g. playout from laptops Etc during a recording).</p>					
					<p class="text-l-mob">Our open-plan office space is designed specifically to facilitate and encourage creative interaction during the entire production process. With free wi-fi, unlimited coffee, editing workstations, boardroom, couches, indoor workspaces and outdoor chill spots, it's easy to see why so many Clients like to work from our offices on recording days.</p>

		<h1 id="header_studios_h1_awiderange">Podcast studios with a wide range of options</h1>

        <p>Our professional studios are designed for podcasts. We accommodate a very wide range of configurations and options to make sure your content is recorded and heard by your target audience.</p>

        <p>From roundtable discussions to monologues, audio books, interviews and armchair chats, we have a studio that fits your needs.</p>

        <p>Studios are configured to suit different inputs, including cell and WhatsApp calls, Zoom, Google Meet, Skype and Microsoft Teams video conferencing.</p>

        <p>We also offer excellent coffee in our famous mugs, with bottled water always available.</p>

		<!-- <p>All our studios are <strong>professionally equipped</strong> for <strong>high-quality recording</strong>, and are <strong>air-conditioned and comfortably furnished</strong>.</p>

		<p>We understand and appreciate that to have open, honest and meaningful conversations, hosts and guests need to feel comfortable and at ease. We also understand that our clients' recording, production, editing and hosting needs vary in complexity and budget.</p>

		<p>We've built 5 dedicated podcast studios (with 5 more coming soon) to meet these varying requirements, and we're certain one of them is perfect for you! From a large, high-counter studio designed for group conversations to a DIY studio ideal for hobbyists, we have a space to match your recording needs.</p>

		<em class="theme-light-grey-mob accent-green-mob">All studios can record Zoom, Meet, Teams, Skype, WhatsApp and POTS (plain old telephone system) conversations, however, for superior remote recording we use Virtual Studio Software like <a href="https://squadcast.fm/?ref=solidgold" target="_blank" ref="noopener" id="header_studios_a_squadcastfm" aria-labelledby="header_studios_a_squadcastfm">SquadCast</a> and <a href="https://riverside.fm?via=gavin" target="_blank" ref="noopener" id="header_studios_a_riversidefm" aria-labelledby="header_studios_a_riversidefm">Riverside</a>.</em>

		<p>Our open-plan office space is designed to facilitate and encourage creative interaction during the entire production process. With unlimited coffee, free Wi-Fi, editing workstations, boardroom, couches, indoor workspaces and outdoor chill spots, it's easy to see why so many clients like to work from our offices on recording days!</p> -->

                        <h3>Pop-up Podcasts</h3>

                        <h4>The studio comes to you</h4>

                        <p>The most expensive part of a podcast is usually the value of the host's and guests' time. This means that travelling to our studios isn't always     viable or practical. More and more we're reminded that content trumps form and clients want to record their public or private podcasts in their own boardrooms, at trade shows, during conferences or even in a moving car (a la Carpool Karaoke).</p>

                        <p>This is why we've invested extensively in Pop-Up Podcastâ„¢ solutions, where professional crew and state-of-the-art equipment bring the studio to you.</p>

						<h3>Studio 4</h3>

						<h4>Large round table and re-configurable furniture</h4>

                        <p>Setting the scene for a conversation has a great influence on the sound of the content. For example, a conversation at a desk or in a studio will sound very different from one held between two people in armchairs with a coffee table and potplant alongside. Similarly, a roundtable discussion works best, well, around a table. For this reason we created this magical 50mÂ² studio where you can select and re-arrange the furniture and backdrop to set the scene for the conversation you want to have.</p>

                        <p>Whether it's couches, beanbags or a fireside chat with a library backdropâ€”hey, even a Wayne's World Bedroom is possibleâ€”you can let your imagination run wild.</p>

                        <p>This studio lends itself to simultaneous video recording.</p>

						<h3>Studio 5</h3>

						<h4>Audio books and webinars</h4>

                        <p>In late 2020, Amazon announced that audio book sales had overtaken ebook sales for the first time. Given the substantial growth we've seen in the number of clients recording audio books, we built an additional studio fit for purpose.</p>

                        <p>It's also ideal for pre-recording webinar presentations.</p>
